# **The Graduate Researcher’s Field Guide to Agency**

**Survival Protocols for the Modern Academic**

*Academia is a reputation economy. Your currency is your Intellectual Property. This guide exists to help you keep it.*

## **What is this?**

This is a collection of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and defensive strategies for graduate students, postdocs, and junior researchers. It is designed to protect your **Intellectual Property (IP)**, ensure **Data Continuity**, and maintain your **Professional Sovereignty** in an environment that often treats you as a temporary resource.

This guide is not anti-science; it is pro-scientist. It leverages the tools of Open Science—reproducibility, transparency, and version control—to create a structural defense against ambiguity and exploitation.
