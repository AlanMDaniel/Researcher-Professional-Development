# **The "I Wish I Knew This Earlier" Guide to Grad School**

**Survival Protocols for the Modern Academic (and Human Being)**

*"Academia is the only industry where you pay tuition to be an employee. Let's make sure you actually own the work you're paying to produce."*

## **Introduction**

Welcome. If you're here, you’ve probably realized that being a graduate student is weird. You're a student, but also staff? You're a mentee, but you're running the lab. And to postdocs, good luck explaining to your new neighbors that you're not a professor or a student but kind of in-between.

Most of the time, this system works fine. But sometimes—usually when a paper is due or a grant is ending—things get messy. "Collaboration" can turn into "Ghost Authorship." "Mentorship" can feel a lot like "Gaslighting." And much like a "prenup" or tire insurance, by the time you know for sure you need it, it's already too late. And I have seen it way to many times before.

This guide isn't about being paranoid; it's about being **professional**. In the real world, people have contracts. In academia, we have vague verbal agreements made in hallways. This site is a collection of tools to help you build your own safety net, timestamp your brilliant ideas, and make sure that when you graduate, your CV actually reflects the work you did.

We’re going to use some fancy Open Science tools (GitHub, OSF, Zenodo), not because we love bureaucracy, but because they create **unbreakable receipts**.

## **The "CYA" (Cover Your... Assets) Modules**

### **🛡️ [The Strategy: Agency & Continuity]({{ site.baseurl }}/principles_of_agency/)**

**Start Here.** The philosophy of keeping your head above water.

* **The "Bus Factor":** Why your data needs to live in three places (none of which should be a USB drive you assume you won't wash).  
* **The "Recap" Maneuver:** The single most powerful email you will ever write.  
* **The Witness Protection Program:** Why your committee is actually your Board of Directors, and why you should talk to them *without* your advisor present.

### **💻 [Protocol A: The Coder's Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/protocol_computational/)**

**For the Python/R/Matlab crowd.**

* **Fork It:** Why working in the lab's repo is like renovating a house you rent. (Spoiler: You need to own the deed).  
* **The Time Machine:** Using **Zenodo** to freeze your code in carbonite so nobody can claim they wrote it three years later.  
* **Hashes:** Using math to prove you had an idea before it was cool.

### **📝 [Protocol B: The Writer's Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/protocol_manuscript/)**

**For the Historians, Psychologists, and Word-Users.**

* **The Dropbox Trap:** Cloud sync is great until someone hits "Delete" on the shared folder. Here is how to stop that.  
* **The "Notary Public":** Using the **Open Science Framework (OSF)** to timestamp your drafts. It’s like mailing a letter to yourself, but digital and legally robust.  
* **The "Zip & Ship":** How to protect sensitive interview data without violating HIPAA or making the IRB sad.

### **🚨 [Emergency Protocols (Break Glass in Case of Fire)]({{ site.baseurl }}/crisis_guide/)**

**For when things have already gone wrong.**

* **So You've Been Ghosted:** What to do when the preprint drops and your name isn't on it. (Hint: Don't panic, and don't send an angry tweet yet).  
* **The "Go Bag":** How to secure your work before you lose server access.  
* **The Whisper Network:** How to warn the next cohort without getting sued for defamation.

## **"Helpful" Resources for Your PI**

Look, maybe your PI isn't malicious. Maybe they're just chaotic good. Or maybe they're just chaotic. If you want to implement these protections without having an awkward "I don't trust you" conversation, use the **Trojan Horse** strategy.

* 📄 [**Standard Operating Procedures for Data Continuity**](https://openprotocols.github.io/PACK/) *(External Link)*  
  * *The Pitch:* "Hey Professor, I found this guide on meeting the new NIH Data Management standards\! It uses Zenodo to make us 'Audit-Ready.' Should we set this up?"  
  * *The Reality:* It tricks them into mandating the exact tools that protect you. You're welcome.
