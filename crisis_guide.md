# **Emergency Protocols: Navigating Authorship Disputes and Toxic Supervision**

**A Field Guide for the Aggrieved**

## **Introduction**

If you are reading this, the system has likely failed you. Whether you call it **ghost authorship**, **credit theft**, or just **being left off a paper**, the mechanism of **academic wage theft** is the same. The standard university channels (HR, Ombuds) often protect the institution, not the student. This guide outlines immediate tactical steps to protect yourself, preserve evidence, and exit safely.

## **Phase 1: Secure the Evidence (The "Go Bag")**

Before you make any formal complaint, you must secure your data. Once a conflict starts, you may lose access to servers and accounts within hours.

### **1\. The Distinction: IP vs. HIPAA**

* **Do Not Steal Data:** If you work with patient data (HIPAA) or protected/classified information, **do not** exfiltrate the raw data. That is a federal crime and will destroy your credibility.  
* **Do Secure Your IP:** You have a right to your *methodology*, *code*, *manuscripts*, and *notes*.  
* **Method:** Use git to push code to a private personal repository. Use local email clients to archive correspondence.

### **2\. The "Soft" Correction Strategy**

If you have been left off a paper, do not immediately accuse the PI of fraud. Frame it as an administrative error to give them a face-saving exit.

* **The Email:** "Hi \[PI\], I saw the new preprint\! It looks great. I noticed my name was missing from the author list, which I assume is just a clerical error given that the analysis relies on the code I wrote in \[Month/Year\]. Let me know if you need me to contact the journal to update the metadata."  
* **The Trap:** If they admit it was an error, you win. If they deny your contribution, you now have written proof of their refusal, which is required for any future inquiry.

## **Phase 2: Documentation & Recording**

Verbal abuse often happens behind closed doors. You need an objective record.

### **1\. Audio Recording Laws**

You must know if your jurisdiction is a **One-Party Consent** state.

* **One-Party Consent:** (e.g., Texas, New York, D.C.) You can legally record a conversation you are part of without informing the other person.  
* **Two-Party Consent:** (e.g., California, Massachusetts, Florida) You *cannot* record without the other person's permission. Doing so is a crime and the evidence is inadmissible.  
* **The Tactic:** If you are in a One-Party state, use a dedicated voice recorder or a phone in "Airplane Mode" (to prevent cloud uploads/calls) during meetings. Keep it discreet. **Do not** upload these recordings to university cloud storage.

### **2\. The "Minutes" Tactic (For Two-Party States)**

If you cannot legally record, you must create "Minutes."

* **Action:** Open a notebook in the meeting. Write down exactly what is said.  
* **Verification:** Immediately after the meeting, email the notes to the PI. "To ensure I understood your feedback, here are my notes from our conversation where you stated \[X\] and \[Y\]."  
* **Why:** A timestamped email containing a transcript of the conversation is the next best thing to a recording.

## **Phase 3: The Whisper Network**

You may feel a moral obligation to warn incoming students, but this carries legal risk (defamation).

* **Rate My Professor / PI Review:** These sites offer anonymity but are not bulletproof.  
* **The "Coffee" Method:** The safest way to warn others is verbally, off-campus.  
* **The Phrasing:** Do not say "He steals data." Say "I found the lab environment chaotic regarding authorship, so I highly recommend you get everything in writing up front." Stick to your subjective experience and verifiable administrative failures.

## **Phase 4: The Exit**

Your career is not this one project. Sometimes you need to consider your own stress and effort, weigh the potential risks and benefits, and decide what is best for you.

* **The Pre-Print:** If you are being ghosted on a paper you wrote, upload your version (or the methodology) to a preprint server (OSF/bioRxiv) immediately. This establishes your priority on the ideas.  
* **Diversify:** Lean on your committee members for letters of recommendation. You do not need the abuser's letter if you have three other strong ones.
